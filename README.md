## Objective

You donâ€™t have to be a stats genius in order to leverage your investment strategy with machine learning!

I challenged myself- build an investing machine with basic level of coding and zero (nearly) math!

The model takes S&P500 historical data and tries to predict daily trends: up or down. Using backtesting (financial method) for accuracy adjustments.

Your mission: Improve it ! You can:
1. Add more variables- Create a mini data. Give each a score and then using an overall score try to predict.
2. Change time duration- try quarterly or even annual predictions.
3. Use language models- you can add a ChatGPT API and ask it to give a score for recent news. Those can be added to the data from the first item!

   
This project builds a Random Forest model to predict daily S&P 500 closing direction (higher or lower) using historical data. This can aid financial decisions like trading, risk management, and investment planning.


### Built With

Python <a href="https://www.python.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/python/python-original.svg" alt="python" width="40" height="40"/> </a>

## Data Source

The historical data for the S&P 500 index is sourced from Yahoo Finance using the `yfinance` library. The data spans multiple decades, allowing for robust analysis and model training.

### Prerequisites


* Yfinance: Fetches financial data (e.g., stock prices, splits) from Yahoo Finance.
  ```sh
  pip install yfinance

* Matplotlib: Creates static, animated, and interactive visualizations (charts, graphs).
  ```sh
  pip install matplotlib

* Sklearn (scikit-learn): Provides machine learning algorithms and tools for data analysis.
  ```sh
  pip install scikit-learn
  
* Pandas: Offers high-performance data structures (Series, DataFrames) for data analysis and manipulation.
  ```sh
  pip install Pandas

## Key Features

### 1. Data Import and Visualization
- The data is imported using `yfinance` and includes historical records of the S&P 500 index.
- Optional visualization is provided to plot the closing prices over time, enabling a visual inspection of trends and patterns.

### 2. Data Cleaning
- Non-essential columns such as Dividends and Stock Splits are removed to streamline the dataset.
- The dataset is filtered to include data from January 1st, 1990 onwards to ensure consistency and relevance.

### 3. Feature Engineering
- A new target variable `Target` is created to indicate whether the index will close higher the next day.
- Historical data is shifted to align today's features with tomorrow's closing price, creating a supervised learning setup.

### 4. Model Training
- A Random Forest Classifier is used for prediction, chosen for its robustness and ability to handle complex datasets.
- The model is trained using features such as Close, Volume, Open, Low, and High prices.
- Training and test datasets are split to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

### 5. Model Evaluation
- The precision score is calculated to assess the accuracy of predictions.
- A combined plot is generated to visually compare the actual versus predicted movements.

### 6. Backtesting
- A backtesting methodology is implemented to evaluate the model's performance over historical data, ensuring the model's robustness and reliability.

### 7. Additional Feature Engineering
- Rolling averages and trend indicators are computed over various time horizons to capture longer-term market movements.
- New predictors such as `Close_Ratio` and `Trend` are added to enhance the model's predictive power.


### Example:
